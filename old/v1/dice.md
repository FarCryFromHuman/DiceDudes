>Dice Symbols and Effects
>* *(Dice can have multiple symbols on a single face; in this case resolve each in the order of your choosing when ordering is required)*
>* All symbols fall into one of three categories
>   * [B]efore battle actions: These are resolved before counting hits and blocks
>   * [A]fter battle actions: These are resolved after hits are taken, before constructs are returned to armies
>   * Hits and blocks: These are added up to determine how many hits players take
>* Dice effects may only be used *once* per effect resolution phase.
>* Sword - Adds 1 hit
>* Shield - Adds 1 block
>* Identity - [B] Set this die to any side, then *don't* set it to the side to denote it has been used; this die can be used again.
>* Hammer - [B] Choose an enemy die in the ether showing a shield; the enemy must return it *(Found on Gladiator)*
>* Fist - [A] Choose an enemy focus on or adjacent to the contested tile; the enemy must return it *(Found on Titan)*
>* Cycle - [B] Choose any die in the ether and reroll it *(Found on Fortuna)*
>* Star - [B] Choose a die from your army, roll it, and place it in the ether *(Found on Centurion)*
>* Reticle - [A] Choose a die in the enemy army; the enemy must return it *(Found on Longinus)*
>* Pillar - [A] Place a pillar on any tile *(Found on Faber)*
>* Mimic - [B+A] Choose a [B] or [A] symbol on any die in the ether matching the phase of the battle and treat this symbol as if it is that symbol, then resolve it. *(Found on Metis - When choosing a symbol, only [B] symbols may be chosen if the battle is in step 4, before battle effects, and only [A] symbols may be chosen if the battle is in step 6, after battle effects. Other Mimic sides may be chosen but effectively do nothing.)*
>* Spiral - [B] Choose an enemy die in the ether showing its Identity side and return it to its controller's pool *(Found on Circe)*
>* Spark - [A] Choose any die you control and return it *(Found on Haruspex)*
