### BATTLE RULES
1. The player initiating the battle chooses a tile and another player who has any focus on the tile. That tile is the battlefield, the initiating player is the attacker, and the other player is the defender.
2. Both players add up their focus. Focus is equal to the amount of foci a player owns on the battlefield and each adjacent tile. Each player chooses a number of constructs from their army up to their focus and moves them to the ether.
3. The attacker rolls battle dice equal to their constructs in the ether. If the attacker has any rerolls, he may use them until he is out.
   * For each SWORD rolled, the defender returns one construct in the ether.
   * For each CLASH rolled, the attacker and the defender each return a construct in the ether.
   * For each BLANK rolled, nothing happens.
   * If the defender must return a construct and cannot, he must return a focus from the battlefield instead.
4. Each player returns any remaining constructs in the ether to their armies.
