## You Are a Wizard
>After years of grueling academics, painstaking experimentation, and deadly practicum, you have done it; you have graduated wizard academy. Unfortunately, no one cares. Only Named Wizards achieve notoriety, and you are a lowly Aspirant, Nameless and desperate to prove your worth. If you defeat enough of your fellow aspirants in The Meld, an ancient and popular wizarding tournament, you may gain the Name you so desire.
>
>Craft constructs and direct them in battle against your opponents as you shape and destroy the field with your magic. Invoke powerful sorceries, subversive cantrips, and subtle rituals to wrest victory from the unworthy.
>
>I'm sure your mother is very proud.

## How to Win
>After you claim a tile, if you have a complete set of three tiles in your player area, you win the game.

## Setup
>1. Each player chooses a player board from the available boards, and places the board and all foci *(for prototype: wooden meeples)* matching that board's color in front of them. Then, each player chooses a side of their board to play with. *(For your first game, we recommend all players use the Aspirant side of their player boards.)*
>2. Form the supply:
>    1. Shuffle the tiles and place them within reach of all players.
>    2. Collect all the basic constructs and place them within reach of all players.
>    3. Collect the unique constructs and set them aside near the basic constructs.

## Game Structure
>1. Select the first player randomly.
>2. Each player takes a full turn, then passes play to the player on their right.
>3. Repeat until the game ends, and a winner is declared.

## Concepts and Components
>Play areas
>* Field: The space in the middle of the table between all players is referred to as the field. Players will place, fight over, and remove tiles from the field.
>* Supply: An area of the game that contains all components that are not currently in use.
>   * Tile stack: The shuffled stack of tiles which players draw from when placing new tiles. New tiles are drawn from the **bottom** of the stack.
>   * Construct supply: All constructs not currently in play reside in the construct supply. Unique constructs are immediately returned to the supply when a player loses control of them. When a player gains control of a unique construct, it is immediately placed in that player's pool.
>* Player board: Used by the player to identify which wizard they are playing, resolve their turn, and keep track of their game state. A player always controls his own board, and everything on it.
>   * Spells: All boards have a number of spells printed on them. There will be an aura that instructs you how to take your turn, a number of cantrips you can use to affect the game state and claim tiles, and likely several rituals you can use to boost the power of your wizard.
>   * Focus slots: Several spell slots on your board will have focus *(prototype: asterisk)* symbols in them. These are special "focus" spell slots. They become blocked by foci over the course of the game. Slots blocked by foci cannot be invoked, and constructs in slots that become blocked by a focus are immediately returned to your pool. When you are instructed to place a focus, you may take a focus from any slot on your board; that slot is now open and may be invoked normally.
>   * Pool: Any constructs not in use reside in your pool. Any time you are instructed to return a construct, return it to your pool unless instructed otherwise. Any time you are instructed to place a construct, remove a construct from your pool and place it. *(If your pool is empty, you may not place contructs from it).*
>   * Army: Constructs in your army can be used in battles. You will have game effects on your board that allow you to place contructs in your army.
>* Ether: A special zone that constructs exist in temporarily during a battle. After a battle, all surviving constructs are immediately returned to the armies of their controlling players.

>Constructs
>* Constructs are represented as six-sided dice
>* Constructs can only exist in the supply, on player boards, in spell slots, and in the ether *(but only when in battle).*
>* Constructs have a "face" side *(prototype: C)*, and 5 other sides showing an assortment of icons.
>* A construct's currently displayed side is only relevant in battle, after being rolled.
>* Some constructs are "unique"; they have a name and there is only one die representing this construct in the supply. They can be acquired by controlling and claiming their corresponding tiles.
>* When an effect refers to "a construct," it normally means any construct. When an effect says to Gain a construct, you gain a basic construct unless otherwise specified by name.

>Foci
>* Foci are represented as wooden cylinders *(prototype: wooden cubes)* matching a player color.
>* Foci can only exist on tiles or on focus spell slots (see player board).
>* Placing foci allows players to control tiles and their spells, claim tiles, have increased power in battle, and have access to more spells on their player boards.

>Tiles
>* Sides: A tile has two sides. When placed, the placing player may choose which side to place face-up: only that side is active.
>* Adjacent: A tile is adjacent to any other tile with which it shares an edge.
>* Glyphs: A tile has 0 to 2 glyphs. These glyphs are used for making patterns on the field, and for forming sets in player areas.
>* Spells: A tile has one or more spells on each side. The player that controls a tile can invoke its spells, and benefits from any of its spell effects.
>* Locked: A tile is locked if removing it would break the field into two pieces. Locked tiles can **never** be moved or claimed.
>* A pattern of tiles is three tiles on the field, all adjacent to each other, that share a glyph.
>* A set of tiles is three tiles in a player's area, all sharing a glyph. After any tile is claimed, if the claiming player shows a full set in their player area, they win the game.

>Spells
>* There are four types of spells - sorceries, cantrips, rituals, and auras.
>* Invoke: The action of placing a construct into a slot on a spell is called **invoking**. When instructed by the game to invoke, take a single construct from your pool and place it on any spell slot **you control**. Then, resolve any necessary effects.
>* **Sorceries** are powerful one-shot spells found only on tiles. A sorcery resolves immediately before the tile hosting it is claimed.
>* **Cantrips** represent the backbone of spells you will use. When you invoke a cantrip, you immediately resolve its effect.
>* **Rituals** are long-term game effects that stay in play as long as all spell slots on the ritual are full and any player controls the component the ritual is printed on. Whoever controls the printed component benefits from the effect of the ritual. 
>   * Dispelled: Whenever no one controls the ritual's host component, or all spell slots are not full, the ritual is dispelled; its effect ceases immediately.
>   * If, when a ritual is dispelled, control of a unique construct would be lost, that construct is immediately returned to the supply.
>* **Auras** are identical to Rituals for all purposes except that they do not have spell slots; as long as the host component is controlled the aura is active and benefiting the player controlling the component.
>* *(For the prototype version, Sorceries are denoted with an X at each corner, Cantrips with a square, Rituals with a circle, and Auras with a slash.)*

>Control
> * Components you control are referred to as **yours** *(ex: your tile, your focus, your construct)*.
>   * You always control all of your foci
>   * You control a tile on the field if you have any number of foci on it.
>   * You control your player board, every component on your player board, and all tiles in your player area
>   * You control all constructs on tiles you control

>Battle
>* When instructed to battle, follow these steps:
>1. **Choose Tile:** Choose a tile on the field with at least one enemy focus; this is the "contested tile" and the controlling player is the "defender". You are the "attacker".
>2. **Count Focus:** You and the defender count focus *(prototype: command)*. A player's focus is equal to the number of their foci on the contested tile and every adjacent tile, plus any of their bonuses to focus.
>3. **Deploy Constructs:** Each player chooses constructs up to their focus from their army, rolls them, and places them in the ether. Each player may reroll any dice of their choice up to the number of rerolls they have (default zero).
>4. **Before Battle Effects**: Starting with the attacker, players take turns resolving [B]efore battle effects. The active player choose a die with [B] effects showing, resolves each [B] effect on the side in an order of his choosing. Once fully resolved, set the die to the side in the ether to denote that its effects have been used. This die is still in the ether and battling for all intents and purposes.
>5. **Deal and Take Hits:** Each player brings all set aside dice in the ether back to the rest of his dice in the ether. Each player takes hits equal to their opponent's swords minus their shields. Each player returns constructs of their choice until they reach the number of hits they took, or as many as possible. If a player has remaining hits, they return their foci from the contested tile in the same way. *(ex: Matt, the attacker, has four dice in the ether. He is showing four swords. Emily, the defender, has two dice in the ether and three foci on the contested tile. She is showing one sword and one shield. After adding together hits and blocks, Matt must take one hit (Emily dealt 1 hit and Matt had no blocks) and Emily must take 3 hits (Matt dealt 4 hits and Emily had 1 block). Matt returns one of his constructs to his pool. Emily returns both of her constructs to her pool, but has one hit left to take. She returns one of her foci on the contested tile to a focus slot on her player board; she now has two foci remaining on the contested tile.)*
>6. **After Battle Effects:** Starting with the attacker, players take turns resolving [A]fter battle effects. The active player choose a die with [A] effects showing, resolves each [A] effect on the side in an order of his choosing. Once fully resolved, set the die to the side in the ether to denote that its effects have been used. This die is still in the ether and battling for all intents and purposes.
>7. **Return Surviors:** All remaining constructs in the ether are returned to their controlling players' armies.

>Legality 
>* Effects may specify legal targets for their resolution. When resolving an effect, only components that meet the requirements for the effect **and** all core game rules may be used to resolve the effect. 
>* *(ex: Player A wants to resolve an effect that says **Move a tile adjacent to an enemy tile**. He may choose any tile to move, unless it is **locked** (core game requirement). He may move it adjacent to any tile controlled by his opponent (effect requirement))*.

>Spell Effects
>* Move tile: Choose a legal, unlocked tile on the field and move it adjacent to any other legal tile, preserving all components on the tiles.
>* Swap tiles: Choose two legal tiles on the field and swap their positions, preserving all components on the tiles.
>* Flip tile: Choose a legal tile on the field and flip it to its other side, replacing all components on the tile on the new side. *(Constructs in ritual slots moved in this way may dispel or activate rituals, but constructs placed in cantrip slots **do not** activate those cantrips. Return any constructs that do not have slots, controller's choice)*.
>* Seal tile: Choose a legal tile in an opponents player area and instruct that player to slide it under their player board; any components on it are immediately returned and it is no longer considered to be in that player's player area until it is unsealed.
>* Claim tile: Choose an unlocked legal tile on the field and place it in your player area; immediately return all components on it. If claiming this tile completes a set in your player area, you win!
>* Place focus: Choose your focus on a focus slot and place it on any legal tile.
>* Return focus: Place the corresponding focus in any focus slot you control; if this slot is full immediately return the construct in this slot.
>* Control [UNIQUE CONSTRUCT]: Take the construct from wherever it currently resides and place it in your pool. You may use it as normal until this effect is dispelled.
>* Gain construct: Take the corresponding construct from the supply and place it in your pool.
>* Return counstruct: Take the corresponding construct from wherever it resides and place it in your pool *(or other area if specifically instructed).*

>Dice Symbols and Effects
>* *(Dice can have multiple symbols on a single face; in this case resolve each in the order of your choosing when ordering is required)*
>* All symbols fall into one of three categories
>   * [B]efore battle actions: These are resolved before counting hits and blocks
>   * [A]fter battle actions: These are resolved after hits are taken, before constructs are returned to armies
>   * Hits and blocks: These are added up to determine how many hits players take
>* Dice effects may only be used *once* per effect resolution phase.
>* Sword - Adds 1 hit
>* Shield - Adds 1 block
>* Identity - [B] Set this die to any side, then *don't* set it to the side to denote it has been used; this die can be used again.
>* Hammer - [B] Choose an enemy die in the ether showing a shield; the enemy must return it *(Found on Gladiator)*
>* Fist - [A] Choose an enemy focus on or adjacent to the contested tile; the enemy must return it *(Found on Titan)*
>* Cycle - [B] Choose any die in the ether and reroll it *(Found on Fortuna)*
>* Star - [B] Choose a die from your army, roll it, and place it in the ether *(Found on Centurion)*
>* Reticle - [A] Choose a die in the enemy army; the enemy must return it *(Found on Longinus)*
>* Pillar - [A] Place a pillar on any tile *(Found on Faber)*
>* Mimic - [B+A] Choose a [B] or [A] symbol on any die in the ether matching the phase of the battle and treat this symbol as if it is that symbol, then resolve it. *(Found on Metis - When choosing a symbol, only [B] symbols may be chosen if the battle is in step 4, before battle effects, and only [A] symbols may be chosen if the battle is in step 6, after battle effects. Other Mimic sides may be chosen but effectively do nothing.)*
>* Spiral - [B] Choose an enemy die in the ether showing its Identity side and return it to its controller's pool *(Found on Circe)*
>* Spark - [A] Choose any die you control and return it *(Found on Haruspex)*
