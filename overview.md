### Dice
* Dice represent Golems, creations brought to life by the players
* Soldier golems are the most basic, each player starts with 10ish?
* Soldier golems are earned each turn, and can be gained by purchasing some Cantrip cards
* Advanced golems can be gained by purchasing some Cantrip cards
* Elite golems are unique, can only be gained by purchasing some Ritual cards
* When a golem is destroyed, it is returned to its owning player's pool
* At the start of each turn, players may recall any spent golems to their pools

### Cards
* Three types: Cantrip, Sorcery, Ritual
* Cantrips are resolved immediately after they are bought and then discarded
* Sorceries are resolved whenever a die is spent to them
* Rituals have persistent effects; these may require dice to be spent to them to be active
* Sorceries and many Rituals have dice slots on them; when a die is spent to the card, that die remains on the card until the player that owns it chooses to recall it at the start of his turn, or when removed through a game effect
* A Sorcery card with no open die slots cannot be triggered by spending a die to it; it is effectively out of charges until dice spent on it are recalled/removed
* A Ritual card may have a minimum number of dice that must be spent to it before it is active; if it doesn't have these dice slots filled, it has no effect. Some rituals also have booster dice slots; the ritual has additional or stronger effects if these slots are filled, but only if it is already active
* Dice slots on cards may be typed; these slots require a *specific* die to be spent

#### Buying a card
* Selection of (6?) available to buy
* Cost of a card is mana equal to cards to the left of it
* When a card is bought: 
  * Move cards to its right left one slot
  * If card is a Cantrip, resolve it immediately and discard it
  * If not, place it in buying player's tableau
  * At start of round, draw cards to replace missing cards and place them to the right

### Field Board
* Nodes: have (1-3?) build locations, can contain one player's golems, may have effects, have a battle size
* Paths: connect nodes, may have effects?

### Wizard Boards
* Mana tracker: When an action that requires mana is taken, dice equal to the mana cost must first be spent from the player's pool to the player's mana tracker. If there are no remaining open slots on the mana tracker, the action cannot be taken.
* Slots on the mana tracker are initially blocked by wells
* Wells are built using an action
* Most actions take 1 mana, except buying cards, and costs can be altered by game effects

### Actions
* Purchase a card: costs amount equal to cards to the left of purchased card; look at Buying a Card
* March: 1 mana, move any number of golems along a path to an empty or allied connected node, or attack a connected enemy node
* Deploy: 1 mana, place (# spires) golems from pool across any allied nodes with Spires
* Construct: (2? spaces on player board) place the leftmost well from your mana track on a building space in an allied node
* Develop: 1 mana, flip a well to its spire side in a node that has no spires
* Other: 1 mana, take any other action available on your wizard board or tableau

### Turn Structure
* Card bank is refilled
* Players recall golems
* Players gain 1 Soldier per Spire they have in play to their pool
* Players alternate taking actions until both pass

### Dice Glyphs
* Sword - deals 1 hit that must be blocked or resolved by your opponent

10 vp to win
When you take a node, place a well
This opens a spot on the Mana track
Spend 1 Mana to flip a well - flipped wells are foci - can summon golems there up to space available, block enemy tile moves, and increase soldiers gained on meditation
Spend golem to well - cards are 1 Mana cheaper - can't flip full well
Rituals - some should provide vp while active
Seal - flip a card face down, unseal at start of next round
Vortex - before keep move golem from adjacent node into this battle and roll him, reroll vortex
Enchant - move enemy golem from their pool to their Mana track
Board is tiles that come out each round and get unraveled for vp, or players spend Mana to pull a new tile and place adjacent to any well
Can spend Mana to move a tile to a new location - can't move next to tile with enemy Foci
Tiles have max golem count - no need to keep dice anymore, just roll all
Attacker deals hits, defender just rolls for shields and other defensive faces
If player loses all wells, game loss or pull a new tile and place well?
Start of round, gain soldiers equal to foci to pool
Unravel tile - 1 Mana, must have a Foci, and full golems, unraveled tiles provide 1 vp each, runs and sets provide +1 vp
Tiles have 4-6 golem spots
Syncopate: sorcery - 1 slot, remove after taking second action to take another action
Each turn is two actions, must take at least one or pass?
Glimmer: All golems have face side - when rolled, can be turned to any side, or placed on research track - when research track full acquire card for free, place all golems on track in pool - track increases in size along with Mana track
Janus/the mask: has 2-3 face sides
Dice faces should have # basic icons equal to tier

Components:

Golems (dice)
* D6, one face side
* Soldier (basic die) Face - Sword - Sword - Sword - Shield - Shield
* Sicarius (targeted elimination) Face - Bullseye - Bullseye - Sword - Sword - Shield
* Centurion (rerolls, defense) Face - Cycle - Cycle - Sword + Shield - Shield x2 - Shield x2
* Gladiator (damage, unblockable) Face - Hammer - Hammer - Sword x2 - Sword x2 - Shield
* Praetorian ()
* Pontifex (mana, )

Loci (tiles)
* Hex tiles with a glyph
* Each locus can hold 4-6 golems depending on size, and a single well (maybe allow more wells - not sure yet)
* A set of tiles is three tiles of the same glyph or three tiles with one of each glyph
* One unique anchor tile that cannot be destroyed, moved, or occupied by golems
* Considering special abilities on loci?

Epiphanies (cards)
* Three types: Cantrip, Sorcery, Ritual
* Cantrips are resolved immediately after they are bought and then discarded
* Sorceries are resolved whenever a die is spent to them, or removed from them
* Rituals have persistent effects; these may require dice to be spent to them to be active
* Sorceries and many Rituals have dice slots on them; when a die is spent to the card, that die remains on the card until the player that owns it chooses to recall it during meditation, or when removed through a game effect
* A Sorcery card with no open die slots cannot be triggered by spending a die to it; it is effectively out of charges until dice spent on it are recalled/removed
* A Ritual card may have a minimum number of dice that must be spent to it before it is active; if it doesn't have these dice slots filled, it has no effect. Some rituals also have booster dice slots; the ritual has additional or stronger effects if these slots are filled, but only if it is already active
* Dice slots on cards may be typed; these slots require a *specific* die to be spent

Laboratory (tableau)
* Mana (needs retheme) - dice are placed on the mana bar as part of the cost of taking actions
  * The mana bar is increased by taking new territory and placing wells
  * Meditating is the main way to empty the mana bar
  * If a well is returned, any die in its slot is returned to the owner's pool
* Glimmers - dice that have rolled their face side and are reserved as glimmers
  * Can be spent instead of mana when purchasing epiphanies
  * Can be recalled during meditation
* Epiphanies - purchased non-cantrip epiphanies become part of the player's tableau
  * Many epiphanies have slots for dice, which can be placed using the place golems action
  * Epiphanies can be sealed, flip them 180 degrees and return any dice spent to them to the owner's pool (respect unique dismissal)
* Score area - some cantrip epiphanies and destroyed tiles are kept here

Game Structure:
Setup
* Place the anchor tile in the middle of the play area
* Shuffle all three epiphany decks and stack them in ascending order
* Deal 5 epiphany cards in a line to form the queue
* Each player takes a player board, 7 wells, and 10 soldiers
* Place the 7 wells on the mana track
* (decide if there needs to be advantages for later players - start with glimmer?)

Win condition/Game end
* Game ends immediately when a player has 10 points in their score area during their turn

  * If you control the destination tile, swap any number of golems between the two tiles, respecting loci limits
  * If the tile is empty, move at least one golem from the starting tile to the destination tile and place a well on the destination tile
  * If your opponent controls the destination tile, battle
  * The attacker may attack with golems from the starting tile and one other tile he controls adjacent to the starting and destination tiles
  * The defender may defend with golems from the destination tile and one other tile adjacent to the destination tile
  * If you win the battle, move surviving golems (at least one, as above) and return the opponent's well/spire
  * If the tile does not have one of your wells on it, place one
  * If reinforcements from other tiles were used, both players may distribute their survivng golems freely
  * If there is not enough room to place all golems, extras are returned to owners' pools

  * Cost is 1 + epiphanies to the left.
  * After buying, slide epiphanies down and draw replacement rightmost from the deck
* Sculpt terrain (create/destroy/move) - place a golem in mana and:
  * Create by drawing a locus at random and placing it adjacent to a locus with a spire you control on it or the anchor
  * Destroy a tile you have fully occupied with golems and a spire and that is not locked - add it to your score area and return spire and golems to your bar/pool
  * Move an unlocked tile you control adjacent to any other tile that does not have a spire controlled by your opponent
* Place golems
  * Place up to 6 golems from your pool between available spaces on your epiphanies and tiles with spires you control

## 3/16/19 - Overhauling tiles, scoring, rolling, etc

>Thought Tiles (rebranded tiles)
> * Thoughts (tiles) now have two sides: a nascent side and a realized side
> * When a tile is placed on the field, it is placed nascent side up
> * When a tile is placed in a player's tableau, it is placed realized side up
> * Nascent side tile features:
>   * Construct slots - 4-6 by tier; this is the number of constructs (dice) that can occupy a tile
>   * Notion slots - 1-3 by tier; this is the number of notions (tokens) that can occupy the tile
>     * Maybe: Abstraction slots - notion slots that start play blocked and must be abstracted to clear; give minor reward (+1 minor construct or something)
>   * Thumbnail of Realized side - the graphic of the realized side's ability, in miniature
>   * Reasoning glyphs - the same glyphs displayed on the realized side, in miniature
> * Realized side tile features:
>   * Ability - revise cantrip/sorcery/ritual here
>   * Reasoning glyphs - two glyphs which allow tiles to be chained into a reasoning (set) when scored

>Wizards
> * Start with a specific complement of dice; "basic" wizard starts with 10 drudges, others have a mix?

>Scoring
> * Score a nascent tile you have a spire on by spending an action and glimmer equal to tier?
> * Win after completing 3 sets?

>Actions
> * Manipulate - place a new tile adjacent to any existing tile, or move an unlocked tile you control adjacent to any other tile without an enemy spire
> * Architect - choose a tile you control; place a structure, or pay glimmer equal to your spires to flip a structure
> * Summon - choose constructs in your pool <= your spires, roll them, place them on locations you control; unplaceable non-glimmer constructs return to pool, or restrict by available slots?
> * Reform - choose a tile you control; reroll all constructs there
> * Command - pick tile
>   * If unoccupied or friendly, pick an amount of constructs in adjacent tiles <= slots on tile, place them on tile, and roll if desired; if you don't have a well here, place a well
>   * If hostile, pick an amount of constructs in adjacent tiles <= slots on tile, roll them in the ether; resolve combat.
>     * If no remaining defenders, move remaining attackers to tile; if any, remove all enemy structures, then place a well 
>     * Otherwise, move remaining attackers to adjacent tiles you control
> * Claim - pick a tile on the field with your spire, spend glimmer equal to its cost, then score the tile
> * Meditate - full turn action, pull any constructs and structures back to your pool, gain 1 drudge for each of your spires
