## You Are a Wizard
>After years of grueling academics, painstaking experimentation, and deadly practicum, you have done it; you have graduated wizard academy. Unfortunately, no one cares. Only Named Wizards achieve notoriety, and you are a lowly Aspirant, Nameless and desperate to prove your worth. If you defeat enough of your fellow aspirants in The Meld, an ancient and popular wizarding tournament, you may gain the Name you so desire.
>
>Craft constructs and direct them in battle against your opponents as you shape and destroy the battleground with your magic. Invoke powerful sorceries, subversive cantrips, and subtle rituals to wrest victory from the unworthy.

>I'm sure your mother is very proud.

## How to Win
>After you claim a tile, if you have a complete set of three tiles in your player area, you win the game.

## Setup
>1. Each player chooses a player board from the available boards, and places the board and all pillars *(for prototype: wooden meeples)* matching that board's color in front of them. Then, each player chooses a side of their board to play with. *(For your first game, we recommend all players use the Aspirant side of their player boards.)*
>2. Form the supply:
>    1. Shuffle the tiles and place them within reach of all players.
>    2. Collect all the basic constructs and place them within reach of all players.
>    3. Collect the unique constructs and set them aside near the basic constructs.

## Game Structure
>1. Select the first player randomly.
>2. Each player takes a full turn, then passes play to the player on their right.
>3. Repeat until the game ends, and a winner is declared.

## Concepts and Components
>Play areas
>* Battlefield: The space in the middle of the table between all players is referred to as the battlefield. Players will place, fight over, and remove tiles from the battlefield.
>* Supply: An area of the game that contains all components that are not currently in use.
>   * Tile stack: The shuffled stack of tiles which players draw from when placing new tiles. New tiles are drawn from the **bottom** of the stack.
>   * Construct supply: All constructs not currently in play reside in the construct supply. Unique constructs are immediately returned to the supply when a player loses control of them. When a player gains control of a unique construct, it is immediately placed in that player's pool.
>* Player board: Used by the player to identify which wizard they are playing, resolve their turn, and keep track of their game state. A player always controls his own board, and everything on it.
>   * Spells: All boards have a number of spells printed on them. There will be an aura that instructs you how to take your turn, a number of cantrips you can use to affect the game state and claim tiles, and likely several rituals you can use to boost the power of your wizard.
>   * Pillar slots: Several spell slots on your board will have pillar *(prototype: asterisk)* symbols in them. These are special "pillar" spell slots. They become blocked by pillars over the course of the game. Slots blocked by pillars cannot be invoked, and constructs in slots that become blocked by a pillar are immediately returned to your pool. When you are instructed to place a pillar, you may take a pillar from any slot on your board; that slot is now open and may be invoked normally.
>   * Pool: Any constructs not in use reside in your pool. Any time you are instructed to return a construct, return it to your pool unless instructed otherwise. Any time you are instructed to place a construct, remove a construct from your pool and place it. *(If your pool is empty, you may not place contructs from it).*
>   * Army: Constructs in your army can be used in battles. You will have game effects on your board that allow you to place contructs in your army.
>* Ether: A special zone that constructs exist in temporarily during a battle. After a battle, all surviving constructs are immediately returned to the armies of their controlling players.

>Constructs
>* Constructs are represented as six-sided dice
>* Constructs can only exist in the supply, on player boards, in spell slots, and in the ether *(but only when in battle).*
>* Constructs have a "face" side *(prototype: C)*, and 5 other sides showing an assortment of icons.
>* A construct's currently displayed side is only relevant in battle, after being rolled.
>* Some constructs are "unique"; they have a name and there is only one die representing this construct in the supply. They can be acquired by controlling and claiming their corresponding tiles.
>* When an effect refers to "a construct," it normally means any construct. When an effect says to Gain a construct, you gain a basic construct unless otherwise specified by name.

>Pillars
>* Pillars are represented as wooden cylinders *(prototype: wooden meeples)* matching a player color.
>* Pillars can only exist on tiles or on pillar spell slots (see player board).
>* Placing pillars allows players to control tiles and their spells, claim tiles, and have access to more spells on their player boards.

>Tiles
>* Sides: A tile has two sides. When placed, the placing player may choose which side to place face-up: only that side is active.
>* Adjacent: A tile is adjacent to any other tile with which it shares an edge.
>* Glyphs: A tile has 0 to 2 glyphs. These glyphs are used for making patterns on the battlefield, and for forming sets in player areas.
>* Spells: A tile has one or more spells on each side. The player that controls a tile can invoke its spells, and benefits from any of its spell effects.
>* Locked: A tile is locked if removing it would break the battlefield into two pieces. Locked tiles can **never** be moved or claimed.
>* A pattern of tiles is three tiles on the battleground, all adjacent to each other, that share a glyph.
>* A set of tiles is three tiles in a player's area, all sharing a glyph. After any tile is claimed, if the claiming player shows a full set in their player area, they win the game.

>Spells
>* There are four types of spells - sorceries, cantrips, rituals, and auras.
>* Invoke: The action of placing a construct into a slot on a spell is called **invoking**. When instructed by the game to invoke, take a single construct from your pool and place it on any spell slot **you control**. Then, resolve any necessary effects.
>* **Sorceries** are powerful one-shot spells found only on tiles. A sorcery resolves immediately before the tile hosting it is claimed.
>* **Cantrips** represent the backbone of spells you will use. When you invoke a cantrip, you immediately resolve its effect.
>* **Rituals** are long-term game effects that stay in play as long as all spell slots on the ritual are full and any player controls the component the ritual is printed on. Whoever controls the printed component benefits from the effect of the ritual. 
>   * Dispelled: Whenever no one controls the ritual's host component, or all spell slots are not full, the ritual is dispelled; its effect ceases immediately.
>   * If, when a ritual is dispelled, control of a unique construct would be lost, that construct is immediately returned to the supply.
>* **Auras** are identical to Rituals for all purposes except that they do not have spell slots; as long as the host component is controlled the aura is active and benefiting the player controlling the component.
>* *(For the prototype version, Sorceries are denoted with an X at each corner, Cantrips with a square, Rituals with a circle, and Auras with a slash.)*

>Control
> * Components you control are referred to as **yours** *(ex: your tile, your pillar, your construct)*.
>   * You always control all of your pillars
>   * You control a tile on the battlefield if you have any number of pillars on it.
>   * You control your player board, every component on your player board, and all tiles in your player area
>   * You control all constructs on tiles you control

>Battle
>* When instructed to battle, follow these steps:
>1. Choose an enemy tile on the battlefield; this is the "contested tile" and the controlling player is the "defender". You are the "attacker".
>2. You and the defender add up will *(prototype: command)*. A player's will is equal to the number of their pillars on the contested tile and every adjacent tile, plus any of their bonuses to will.
>3. Each player chooses constructs up to their will from their army, rolls them, and places them in the ether.
>4. Starting with the attacker, each die showing a face side must be set to any other side on the die.
>5. Starting with the attacker, non-hit dice abilities are resolved (rerolls, will, etc).
>6. Each player takes hits equal to their opponent's swords minus their shields.
>7. Each player returns constructs of their choice until they reach the number of hits they took, or as many as possible. If the defender has remaining hits, they return pillars from the contested tile in the same way.
>8. Starting with the attacker, each player resolves any after battle effects they control.
>9. All remaining constructs in the ether are returned to their controlling players' armies.

>Legality 
>* Effects may specify legal targets for their resolution. When resolving an effect, only components that meet the requirements for the effect **and** all core game rules may be used to resolve the effect. 
>* *(ex: Player A wants to resolve an effect that says **Move a tile adjacent to an enemy tile**. He may choose any tile to move, unless it is **locked** (core game requirement). He may move it adjacent to any tile controlled by his opponent (effect requirement))*.

>Effects
>* Move tile: Choose a legal, unlocked tile on the battleground and move it adjacent to any other legal tile, preserving all components on the tiles.
>* Swap tiles: Choose two legal tiles on the battleground and swap their positions, preserving all components on the tiles.
>* Flip tile: Choose a legal tile on the battleground and flip it to its other side, replacing all components on the tile on the new side. *(Constructs in ritual slots moved in this way may dispel or activate rituals, but constructs placed in cantrip slots **do not** activate those cantrips)*.
>* Seal tile: Choose a legal tile in an opponents player area and instruct that player to slide it under their player board; any components on it are immediately returned and it is no longer considered to be in that player's player area until it is unsealed.
>* Claim tile: Choose an unlocked legal tile on the battleground and place it in your player area; immediately return all components on it. If claiming this tile completes a set in your player area, you win!
>* Place pillar: Choose your pillar on a pillar slot and place it on any legal tile.
>* Return pillar: Place the corresponding pillar in any pillar slot you control; if this slot is full immediately return the construct in this slot.
>* Control [UNIQUE CONSTRUCT]: Take the construct from wherever it currently resides and place it in your pool. You may use it as normal until this effect is dispelled.
>* Gain [CONSTRUCT]: Take the corresponding construct from the supply and place it in your pool.
>* Return [CONSTRUCT]: Take the corresponding construct from wherever it resides and place it in your pool *(or other area if specifically instructed).*

>Dice Faces
>* *(Dice can have multiple symbols on a single face; in this case resolve each in the order of your choosing when ordering is required)*
>* Sword - Deals 1 hit
>* Shield - Blocks 1 hit
>* Hammer - Deals 1 unblockable hit; ignore one of your opponent's rolled shields *(Found on Titan)*
>* Cycle - Reroll 1 other die before dealing and taking hits *(Found on Centurion)*
>* Star - Gain +1 will for this battle; immediately roll one die from your army into the ether *(Found on Centurion)*
>* Reticle - After battle, if this die is still in the ether, return one die of your choice in your opponent's army to their pool *(Found on Longinus)*
