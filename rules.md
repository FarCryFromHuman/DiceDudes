# UNNAMED WIZARD GAME BLIND PLAYTEST RULES
## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to Unnamed Wizard Game V2. You are an unnamed wizard fresh out of wizarding school, trying to make a name for yourself in a very competitive industry. You've chosen a very direct path; competition in The Harrowing as an Aspirant. The Harrowing is a battle of wits and wills against other wizards vying for a single prize: a name to call your own.

## COMPONENTS
#### 4 Player Boards
* Foamcore player boards
* Each board features a duplicate Aspirant (beginner) side and a unique, Named (advanced) side
* Each player board has a unique color matching a set of pillars
#### 40 Focus Pillars
* 4 sets of 10 wooden cylinders each, by color, referred to as **pillars**
* Each color of pillar corresponds to a single player board
#### 80 Power Cubes
* Acrylic cubes in a number of colors, referred to as **power**
* Colors have no significance - all cubes are treated the same
#### 40 Field Tiles
* 4 sets of 10 cards each - referred to as tiles
* Tiles are hexagonal and two-sided
* Each set contains a core tile, 3 wild tiles, and 6 unique tiles
* Tiles are marked with a numeral to denote which set they belong to *(see tile anatomy)
#### 10 Battle Dice
* 10 custom, identical, acrylic dice

## HOW TO GET A NAME
You are in this competition to win. Here is how you do it:
> After a player claims a tile, if that player has claimed any three tiles with matching runes, the game is over and that player wins.

In long form, each player is looking to claim a set of three tiles with matching symbols (called runes). Once a single player has done so, that player's wizard wins The Harrowing, and is granted a name (or the wizard is already named and is just showing off). Claiming tiles is not a simple process, and players will be working directly against each other to squeeze out a victory.

## SETUP

#### Player Areas
1. Determine which player is first randomly.
2. Starting with the first player and moving clockwise, each player takes a player board and the set of pillars matching its color.
3. Each player chooses to play with the Aspirant (beginner) or Named (advanced) side of their board. *(For the first game, play with the Aspirant side. You should try earning your name.)*
#### The Field
4. The last player chooses a core tile and places it in the middle of the field.
5. In reverse player order, each player chooses a set of tiles.
6. Shuffle the chosen sets into a single stack and place them to the side of the field.
#### The Supply
7. Place all cubes and the battle dice to the side of the field.
8. This isn't a step, it's time to battle.

## GAME STRUCTURE
> Beginning with the first player, each player takes a full turn, then passes play to the player to the left (called **player order**). This continues until the game ends *(see HOW TO GET A NAME)*.

## TURN STRUCTURE
> When a player is taking their turn, they are known as the **active player**.
> To take a turn, the active player executes the instructions on their player board, in order. Once all instructions are complete, the active player's turn is over.

> START OF TURN - Some game effects may reference *start of turn.* These effects resolve at the start of the active player's turn, *before any other instructions on the active player's board are executed*, in whichever order the active player desires. Any players with effects that resolve at the start of other players' turns resolve them in player order after the active player. Once all start of turn effects are resolved, play proceeds as normal; the active player begins executing the instructions on their player board.

> END OF TURN - Some game effects may reference *end of turn.* These effects resolve at the end of the active player's turn, *after all instructions on the active player's board are executed*, in whichever order the active player desires. Any players with effects that resolve at the end of other players' turns resolve them in player order after the active player. Once all end of turn effects are resolved, play proceeds as normal; the next player becomes the active player and begins their turn.

## GAME CONCEPTS
#### Spells and Invocation
Spells are the core mechanic with which a player interacts with the field and their player board. There are four types of spells, denoted with four different colors and border styles. 
* **Sorceries** are denoted with a gold border, and are only present on tiles. These powerful spells only come into effect once per game, when the tile they belong to is claimed.
> SORCERIES - Before a tile containing a sorcery is claimed, the active player resolves that sorcery's effects, then adds the tile to their player area as normal.
* **Cantrips** are denoted with a silver border. These basic spells allow wizards to accomplish a huge variety of tasks, and come into effect every time they are invoked.
> CANTRIPS - Cantrips only have an effect when they are **invoked**.
* **Rituals** are denoted with a bronze border. These spells have lasting, positive effects that endure as long as they are fully invoked, and benefit all players that own them.
> RITUALS - The effects of a ritual always benefit all players that own it, as long as it is **fully invoked**.
* **Auras** are denoted with a black border. These passive spells bestow long-term effects just like rituals, but do not require invocation.
> AURAS - The effects of an aura always benefit all players that own it.

Both cantrips and rituals have at least one **invocation slot**, denoted as empty squares. Players place their power cubes on invocation slots to invoke the spell the slots belong to.
> INVOKE - When ordered to invoke, the active player chooses an empty invocation slot on a cantrip or ritual they own. The active player then places one cube from their pool on that invocation slot, and follows the correct instructions below: 

> INVOKING A CANTRIP - The active player immediately resolves the effect of the cantrip, then play continues as normal.

> INVOKING A RITUAL - If there are no remaining empty invocation slots on the ritual, it is **fully invoked**; its effects now benefit all players that own it. If there are still remaining empty invocation slots, nothing happens. In either case, play continues as normal.

> AUTO-RETURN SLOTS - These special invocation slots can appear on cantrips and are denoted by gold bursts around their edges. At the end of the active player's turn, after all end of turn effects are resolved, all power cubes in auto-return invocation slots owned by the active player are returned by the active player.


#### Pillars and Power
Pillars signify a player's ownership of tiles and the strength they can bring to bear in battle. Each player has a number of pillars in their player color. These pillars will begin play in a given player's pool, are placed on tiles on the field, and are returned to the pool through battle, claiming, and other effects.

>PILLAR TERMS:
>* OWNERSHIP: A player always owns all pillars in their player color. A player also owns any tiles on the field with any amount of their pillars on them.

>PILLAR-RELATED EFFECTS:
>* VALIDITY: Effects may specify which pillars are valid for their resolution. These rules must be taken into account when manipulating pillars, as well as the rules below.
>* PLACE: Take a pillar from your pool and place it on a tile on the field.
>* RETURN: Take a pillar from a tile on the field and place it in its owner's pool.
>* MOVE: Move a pillar from a tile on the field to another tile on the field.

Power is the raw magical energy players use to invoke cantrips and rituals, using their effects to alter the field in advantageous ways. Power is represented by cubes and can exist in any spell slot, on player boards (in their pools, fortresses, and ethers), and in any other zone that allows them.

>POWER TERMS:
>* OWNERSHIP: A player owns all power on their player board, and all power in spell slots on tiles they own.

>POWER-RELATED EFFECTS:
>* PLACE: Take a power cube from your pool and place it in the target zone or spell slot.
>* RETURN: Take a power cube and place it in its owner's pool. If multiple players own the power, the player returning the power chooses which owning player's pool to place it in. *(NOTE: In this way, it is possible to "steal" other players' power, and redistribute it accordingly. Steatling power can be an important tactic to prevent someone from running away with the game!)*


#### Player Boards
> PLAYER OWNERSHIP - A player *always* owns the following: 
> * Their player board
> * All spells on their player board
> * All claimed tiles and spells on them in their player area
> * All power cubes on their player board and on their claimed tiles
> * All pillars matching their player color (regardless of where they are located)

Each player board hosts a number of zones and spells, and these are different across each named wizard side. Some named wizards will have some types of zones and spells and others will not; named wizards will often have unique zones and spells with special mechanics. For details on these, refer to each named wizard's section in the rulebook.  

Aspirant board sides are identical apart from color and always have the same three zones; the **pool**, the **fortress** and the **ether**. They also have a large aura describing their turn structure, a section containing a number of cantrips they may use on their turn, and a section containing a handful of rituals that provide them passive benefits when fully invoked. See the aspirant entry in the wizard's section in the rulebook for more details.

The **pool**, **fortress** and **ether** are described below, as they appear on aspirant board sides and many named wizard board sides, along with **meditate**, an effect common to most wizards that typically allows them to sacrifice their turn to reorganize their power cubes.

>POOL - The pool contains all a player's power cubes that are not currently in use. Whenever a player is ordered to invoke, they must place a cube from their pool to do so, and if they are out of cubes they may not take the invocation action. Whenenver a player **returns** a cube they own, they return it to their pool, unless otherwise specified.

>FORTRESS - The fortress contains power cubes the player has committed for wizardly combat. They may not be used to invoke, and are commonly returned to a player's pool as they are destroyed in battle or optionally during **meditation**.

>ETHER - The ether contains power cubes currently committed to battle *(see BATTLE below)*. Outside of battle, the ether is empty and has no gameplay effect.

>MEDITATE - Most wizards have an effect labeled **meditate**. The exact details of the effect may vary from wizard to wizard, but any effects owned by the active player that occur before or after **meditation** trigger from the resolution of the active player's **meditate** effect. If the active player has no meditate effect, they cannot trigger abilities associated with it.

#### The Field and Tiles
The field is comprised of a dynamic assortment of tiles arranged around 2-4 **core** tiles. Tiles are **placed** from the stack adjacent to other tiles on the field, and are removed from the field and added to player areas when **claimed**. Typically, a player may only claim a tile when it is in a specific pattern, and they own all tiles in the pattern.

>CORE TILES: There is one core tile per set, and one will be placed into play at the start of the game to create the field. Core tiles are never owned, and cannot be claimed, removed, or manipulated in any way. Spells on core tiles are always owned by all players.

>TILE TERMS:
>* RUNES: Each set has 9 tiles with runes on them. Some tile sides may have two runes, while others have one. A tile side with two runes is considered to have both runes for purposes of claiming and for completing a winning set of three.
>* WILD: Each set has three wild tiles. These tiles typically allow the claiming player to gain power cubes, and are identical on both sides. They also count as having every rune for purposes of claiming, but as having no runes for purposes of completing a winning set of three.
>* ADJACENCY: A tile on the field is considered adjacent to any tile it shares at least one side with.
>* OWNERSHIP: A tile on the field is owned by any player with at least one pillar on it. Spells and power cubes on tiles on the field are owned by all players that own the tile. A claimed tile in a player area is owned by that player.
>* LOCKED: A tile on the field is considered locked if moving it from its position would separate the field into two disconnected segments of tiles. Locked tiles may never be claimed or moved, but they may be manipulated in other ways.
>* OPEN: A tile on the field is considered open if no players have any pillars on it. Power cubes do not contribute to openness; only pillars.
>* INVOKED: A tile is considered to be invoked if it has a spell with at least one invoked spell slot. *(Tiles with only sorceries and/or auras can never be considered invoked.)*
>* PATTERN: Tiles are considered to be in a pattern if they are arranged in the postions depicted by the pattern and all share at least one matching rune.

There are a number of game effects that manipulate tiles.
>TILE-RELATED EFFECTS:
>* VALIDITY: Effects may specify which tiles are valid for their resolution. These rules must be taken into account when manipulating tiles, as well as the rules below.
>* PLACE: Draw a tile from the bottom of the stack, choose a side, and place it adjacent to any tile on the field.
>* MOVE: Only **unlocked** tiles on the field may be moved. To move a tile, take it from its current position and place it adjacent to another tile on the field.
>* SWAP: Take two tiles from their current positions and place them in each others' positions.
>* FLIP: The resolving player returns all power cubes on the tile, picks up all pillars on the tile, flips it to its other side, then replaces all the pillars on it.
>* ROTATE: Choose three tiles adjacent to each other on the field and "rotate" their positions clockwise or counter-clockwise, such that they each occupy the former position of their neighbor in the direction of rotation.
>* CLAIM: Only **unlocked** tiles on the field may be claimed. To claim a tile, the resolving player returns all power cubes **then** pillars on the tile, and then the resolving player takes the tile and places it in their player area. *(If that player then has a matching set of three tiles in their player area, that player wins the game.)*
>* SEAL: Only **claimed** tiles can be sealed. When a tile is sealed, the player who owns it returns all power cubes and pillars on it and slides it partially underneath their player board. That player still owns that tile, but it is considered to have no runes or spells. When a tile is unsealed, slide it back out from underneath its owner's player board; it is now considered to have all its runes and spells once more.

#### Battle
Game effects may require the resolving player to battle. To resolve a battle, these steps must be followed, in order:
>BATTLE  
>The resolving player is considered the **attacker**.
>1. The attacker chooses a tile on the field owned by any other player, and one of the players that owns it. That tile is considered the **battleground**, the chosen player is considered the **defender**, and both players are considered **combatants**.
>2. Each combatant counts all the pillars they own on and adjacent to the battleground. This value is considered the combatant's **strength**.
>3. Each combatant takes as many power cubes as possible up to their strength from their fortress and places them in their ether.
>4. The attacker takes a number of battle dice equal to the number of cubes in their ether, to a maximum of ten, and rolls them. If they have any rerolls, they may reroll any dice of their choice as many times as they have rerolls.
>5. The attacker returns one cube in their ether for each clash rolled. The defender returns one cube in their ether for each *hit and clash* rolled. For each power the defender could not return, they return one of their pillars from the battleground instead. *(If the defender cannot return enough of their pillars to cover the remainder, nothing else happens - the extra hits are "wasted.")*
>6. Each player returns any cubes remaining in their ethers to their respective *fortresses* - not their pools.
