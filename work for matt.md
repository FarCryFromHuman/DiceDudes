#### General notes
* Dice slots need to fit 16mm dice
* In general, don't spend too much time on these or get too attached, as there will certainly need to be changes.
* I want your opinions as much as your work, so feel free to argue with me about any of this

#### Player Board
* 3-column layout
* First column has cantrips, then auras
* Second column has army, then pool
* Third column has rituals, then unused space (feel free to do what you like here)
* Think about the size of Root player boards

#### Tile Anatomy
* Hexes, oriented with flat sides on top and bottom
* Top half of hex is art
* Bottom half of hex contains any relevant spells (usually one)
* Left and right corners may contain small glyphs
* Maybe note that tiles are different on each side?
* Use an example from the game

#### The Ether
* Just show handfuls of dice on each player side
* Show some set to the side slightly because their effects have been used
* We can talk about this one, i dont need it immediately and its probably going to need to be a series of images

#### Player board anatomy
* Smaller image of the aspirant (normal) player board
* Note the six important areas (unused space as whatever you like, but note that on some boards additional mechanics may exist there)
* Point out a spell slot that's a focus slot

#### Spell anatomy
* Four, one for each spell type
* Dice slots, if necessary
* Text to the right of dice slots (we'll try our hand at iconography for these later)
* Unique borders and colors for each spell type (I'm thinking gold for sorceries, silver for cantrips, bronze for rituals, black for auras)
* Use spells from the game

#### Dice Symbols Key
* Knock yourself out on the icons, but you can avoid spending time on that if you'd rather not
* Size them for 16mm but we will need to shrink them for some dice, you'll probably vector anyway
* Use the list I have in the rules, I don't think it'll change much
* After the face, abbreviated rules, and the name of the associated unique construct

#### Spell types key
* Samples of border art and color with associated spell type and abbreviated rules

#### Play area anatomy
* Show player boards, some claimed tiles, tiles on the field, the supply of dice, the stack of tiles, and populate some stuff arbitrarily
* This will likely take some work, def save it for later
